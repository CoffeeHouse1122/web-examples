        Rubber ducky, the unsung hero of bubble baths, floats triumphantly like
        a tiny, yellow battleship of joy, quacking silently as it surveys the
        soapy abyss. Its beady black eyes hold secrets of bathtime lore, and its
        squeak? Oh, that squeak is the anthem of chaos itself, a symphony of
        playful absurdity. It bobs up and down, defying gravity and logic, a
        plastic enigma in a frothy sea, daring you to question its purpose. Is
        it just a toy? Or a philosopher disguised as bathroom decor? Some say
        rubber duckies are spies from the aquatic underworld, plotting to
        overthrow soap dishes everywhere. Others believe they’re
        interdimensional beings, slipping between realms to bring whimsy to the
        mundane. All hail the rubber ducky, a deity of delightful nonsense,
        ruler of tubs, pools, and puddles alikeRubber ducky, the unsung hero of
